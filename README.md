# RAPIDS-NVTabular-Horovod-Spark-Databricks
This repo contains my work based on my Nvidia internship as a Data Science Intern. 

⚡️ I worked on the project "Multi-Step Time Series Forecasting with GPU accelerated stack using NVIDIA GPU Cloud, RAPIDS Spark, NVTabular, and Horovod". Check the published blog post here medium.com/@ai21mtech02002/e5c9e83ebd04

⚡️ Improved distributed model training speed by 10% by converting the data loading pipeline from Uber Petastorm to
NVTabular TensorFlow Keras Sequence Loader on Azure Databricks platform with RAPIDS - cuML and cuDF libraries.

Worked on **data engineering aspect** of a Multi Step Time Series Forecasting problem with GPU accelerated stack on Nvidia GPU Cloud. Check out work: [Distributed Data Science using NVTabular on Spark \& Dask](https://www.medium.com/@ai21mtech02002/e5c9e83ebd04)

Improved \textbf{distributed model training speed upto 10\%} thorugh the migration of the data loading pipeline from Petastorm to KerasSequenceLoader. \faGithub\ \emph{\href{https://www.github.com/Tauhait/RAPIDS-NVTabular-Horovod-Spark-Databricks}{\textcolor{blue}{RAPIDS-NVTabular-Horovod-Spark-Databricks}}}
